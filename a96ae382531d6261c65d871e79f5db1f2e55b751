It\u0027s checking if those files are in %{buildroot}, I guess you need to check if they are in the actual repo, not in %buildroot, so it\u0027s not copying them under _sysconfdir.\n\nAlso, those config files are not in %files, so it would not include them.\n\nFinally, i think if we want to store config files, we should put them under /etc/os-diff/ folder or something like that, not in /etc/ directly. Do those config files have credentials? if so, be careful with permissions.",
